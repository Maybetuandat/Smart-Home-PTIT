## About this project:
This project aims to create a smart home system using ESP32 and various sensors. The Android app allows users to monitor and control devices remotely.

### 1. Hardware
   - **ESP32**: Microcontroller for connecting sensors and sending data.
   - **DHT11**: Temperature and humidity sensor.
   - **LDR**: Light-dependent resistor for detecting light levels.
   - **LED**: Indicator light.

### 2. Software
   - **Type**: Android App
   - **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) for clear separation of concerns and better maintainability.
   - **Language**: Kotlin
   - **UI**: Jetpack Compose for modern, reactive UI development.
   - **Backend**: Integration with a server for data logging and device management.
   
### 3. Key Features:
   - Real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, and light levels.
   - Remote control of devices like LEDs.
   - User-friendly interface built with Jetpack Compose.
   - Notifications for threshold exceedances in temperature or light.
